abstract: What role do the emotions of subject and object play in judging the beauty
  of images and music? Eighty-one participants rated perceived beauty, liking, perceived
  happiness, and perceived sadness of 24 songs, 12 art images, and 12 nature photographs.
  Stimulus presentation was brief (2 seconds) or prolonged (20 seconds). The stimuli
  were presented in two blocks, and participants took the Positive and Negative Affect
  Score (PANAS) mood questionnaire before and after each block. They viewed a mood
  induction video between blocks either to increase their happiness or sadness or
  to maintain their mood. Using linear mixed-effects models, we found that perceived
  object happiness predicts an increase in image and song beauty regardless of duration.
  The effect of perceived object sadness on beauty, however, is stronger for songs
  than images and stronger for prolonged than brief durations. Subject emotion affects
  brief song beauty minimally and prolonged song beauty substantially. Whereas past
  studies of beauty and emotion emphasized sad music, here we analyze both happiness
  and sadness, both subject and object emotion, and both images and music. We conclude
  that the interactions between emotion and beauty are different for images and music
  and are strongly moderated by duration.
