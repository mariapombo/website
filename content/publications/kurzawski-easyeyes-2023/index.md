summary: Our crosshair tracking method ensures participants are fixating during a brief peripheral target presentation, eliminating the need for an eye tracker for online, fixation-dependent, vision experiments.

abstract: 'Online methods allow testing of larger, more diverse populations, with
  much less effort than in-lab testing. However, many psychophysical measurements,
  including visual crowding, require accurate eye fixation, which is classically achieved
  by testing only experienced observers who have learned to fixate reliably, or by
  using a gaze tracker to restrict testing to moments when fixation is accurate. Alas,
  both approaches are impractical online as online observers tend to be inexperienced,
  and online gaze tracking, using the built-in webcam, has a low precision (±4 deg).
  EasyEyes open-source software reliably measures peripheral thresholds online with
  accurate fixation achieved in a novel way, without gaze tracking. It tells observers
  to use the cursor to track a moving crosshair. At a random time during successful
  tracking, a brief target is presented in the periphery. The observer responds by
  identifying the target. To evaluate EasyEyes fixation accuracy and thresholds, we
  tested 12 naive observers in three ways in a counterbalanced order: first, in the
  laboratory, using gaze-contingent stimulus presentation; second, in the laboratory,
  using EasyEyes while independently monitoring gaze using EyeLink 1000; third, online
  at home, using EasyEyes. We find that crowding thresholds are consistent and individual
  differences are conserved. The small root mean square (RMS) fixation error (0.6 deg)
  during target presentation eliminates the need for gaze tracking. Thus, this method
  enables fixation-dependent measurements online, for easy testing of larger and more
  diverse populations.'
