abstract: Is beauty subjective or objective? Once limited to Philosophy, this question
  is increasingly capturing scientistsâ€™ attention. Here, we discuss neuroscientific
  support for both viewpoints. Our discussion includes the Processing Fluency Theory
  and a reinforcement-learning model of aesthetic values. We conclude both aspects
  of beauty derive from utilitarian brain mechanisms.
