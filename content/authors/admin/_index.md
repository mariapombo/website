#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student working with Dr. Denis Pelli at New York University (NYU). I am interested in using psychological tools to characterize aesthetic judgment and its influence on everyday decisions. My work ranges from basic science to applied settings.
