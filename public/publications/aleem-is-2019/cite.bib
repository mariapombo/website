 abstract = {Is beauty subjective or objective? Once limited to Philosophy, this question is increasingly capturing scientists’ attention. Here, we discuss neuroscientific support for both viewpoints. Our discussion includes the Processing Fluency Theory and a reinforcement-learning model of aesthetic values. We conclude both aspects of beauty derive from utilitarian brain mechanisms.},
